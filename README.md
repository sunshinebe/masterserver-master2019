## About Master Server Framework

Develop, run and debug your back-end server like a regular Unity game, within editor. No tedious multi-language setups, no third party services with monthly subscriptions, no cap on CCU or traffic, host on win and linux VPS, full source code - even if I die, you move forward. Based on socket connections (think Photon Server, just without caps and monthly payments).
